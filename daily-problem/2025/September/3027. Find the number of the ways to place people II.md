# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Try all possible pairs for Alice and Bob. The goal is to make sure the rectangle formed by their positions does **not** include any other points.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Sort the points by x ascending and y descending. For each possible upper-left corner (Alice), scan to the right for lower-right corners (Bob). Use a variable to track the largest y seen so far to quickly verify the rectangle is empty inside.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$  
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $O(n)$  
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def numberOfPairs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort by x ascending, y descending
        points.sort(key=lambda p: (p[0], -p[1]))
        
        ans = 0
        n = len(points)

        # Enumerate possible upper-left corners (Alice)
        for i in range(n):
            max_y = -math.inf
            xi, yi = points[i]

            # Enumerate possible lower-right corners (Bob)
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                xj, yj = points[j]

                # Check if no other points are inside/on the fence
                if yi >= yj > max_y:
                    ans += 1
                    max_y = yj # Update the largest y seen in this interval
        
        return ans
```
