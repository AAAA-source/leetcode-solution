# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We can reason about the outcome by considering different situations:
1. No vowels â†’ Bob wins.
2. Odd number of vowels: Alice removes the entire `s` and wins.
3. Even number of vowels: Alice first removes a subarray containing one vowel. This leaves an odd number of vowels for her next turn, which again guarantees her win.

Thus, Alice wins if and only if `s` contains at least one vowel.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def doesAliceWin(self, s: str) -> bool:
        for c in s:
            if c in 'aeiou':
                return True
        return False
```
