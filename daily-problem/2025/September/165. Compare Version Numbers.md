# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We are asked to compare two version strings. Each version consists of revisions separated by dots `"."`.  
The natural way is to split the strings into tokens and compare their integer values from left to right.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Use two `stringstream` objects initialized with `version1` and `version2`.  
- Extract each revision using `getline(..., '.')`.  
- Convert the token to integer with `stoi`.  
- If one stream runs out of tokens, treat the missing value as `0`.  
- Compare the current revisions:
  - If `x < y`, return `-1`.  
  - If `x > y`, return `1`.  
- Continue until both streams are exhausted.  
- If all revisions are equal, return `0`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n + m)$$ where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the two version strings. 
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
        stringstream ss1(version1), ss2(version2);
        string token1, token2;
        while (true) {
            int x = 0, y = 0;
            if (getline(ss1, token1, '.')) x = stoi(token1);
            if (getline(ss2, token2, '.')) y = stoi(token2);

            if (x < y) return -1;
            if (x > y) return 1;

            if (!ss1 && !ss2) break;  
        }
        return 0;

    }
};
```
