# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
When we traverse the nums array , we can use a hash map or array to record each value frequency. 

Then each time we update the frequency , there are two cases : 
Case 1 : if the frequency is larger than max frequency , then update the frequency and the total frequency.
Case 2 : if the frequenct is same as max frequency , then just sum up total frequency.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Here we use vector(array) to record the frequency for each value.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
we need O(n) time to traverse the  nums array.

- Space complexity: $O(n)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
We need O(n) space to record the frequency for each value (using array or hash map)

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> freq(101) ; // store value -> frequency

        int max_freq = -1 ;
        int ans = 0 ;
        for(auto &i : nums) {
            freq[i]++ ;
            if ( freq[i] > max_freq ) {
                max_freq = freq[i] ;
                ans = max_freq ;
            }
            else if ( freq[i] == max_freq ) {
                ans += max_freq ;
            }
        }

        

        return ans ;
    }
};
```
