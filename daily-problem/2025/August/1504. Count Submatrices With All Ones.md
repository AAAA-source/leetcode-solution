"""
problem associate with dp
start from small case
1, 1, 1
1, 1, 0
Suppose there is a dp that dp[i][j] is the ans then it should looks like
1, 2, 3
2, 5, 6
doesn't seems having a relation

Try with a dp that the sum of dp is the ans. 
we need a dp where dp[i][j] means how many squares is matrix[i][j] contained in 
1, 1, 1
1, 2, 0
-> sum of it is six

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
"""
define dp[i][j] as the side length of the largest square that has its bottom-right corner at (i, j).
then dp[i][j] = k 
contains the square from (m[i-(k-1)][j-(k-1)], dp[i][j]), (m[i-(k-2)][j-(k-2)], dp[i][j])...... k squares. Note that the the square we count will not overlap

matrix[i][j]= 0 -> dp[i][j] = 0
matrix[i][j]= 1 -> dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
