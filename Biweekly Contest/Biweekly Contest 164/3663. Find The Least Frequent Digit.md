# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Just count the number occurrences , and remember to skip the number that doesn't appear ever.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We use a hash-map or an array record the occurrences of numbers.
And Each time record the last digit of n , and then divided by 10.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(logn)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
We need O(logn) time to count every digit in n.

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
There is only 0 ~ 9 will be record , so the array is constant size.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int getLeastFrequentDigit(int n) {
        vector<int> freq(10) ;

        while (n > 0) {
            freq[n % 10]++ ;
            n /= 10 ;
        }
        int minfreq = INT_MAX ;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0 && minfreq > freq[i] )
                minfreq = freq[i];
        }
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) {
            if ( freq[i] == minfreq )
                return i ;
        }
        return -1 ;
    }
};
```
