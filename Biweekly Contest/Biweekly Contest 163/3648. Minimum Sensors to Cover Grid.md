# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We are going to greedy place sensor in center of grid. So each sensor can cover a square with 2k + 1 length. 

In this way , we just need to compute how many squares can cover all grids.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(1)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
we just need to do some arithmetic operations , take O(1) time.

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
We only need constant space for variables.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int minSensors(int n, int m, int k) {
        int rownum = n / (2 * k + 1) + ((n % (2 * k + 1) == 0)? 0 : 1 );
        int columnnum = m / (2 * k + 1) + ((m % (2 * k + 1) == 0)? 0 : 1) ;
        return rownum * columnnum ;
    }
};
```
